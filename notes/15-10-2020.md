Two varieties of notions of a CwF internal to type theory: set-truncated and "$\infty$-", i.e. with all higher coherences.
In the reference list above the first is formulated in an extensional metatheory and is automatically truncated, while the second is $\infty$-.

For this note and the problem we're considering we'll focus on the set-truncated version.
