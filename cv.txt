About
-----
I'm a PhD candidate in computer science at the [Functional Programming Lab][1.1]
of the University of Nottingham, advised by [Nicolai Kraus][1.2].

The goal of my research is to use type theory to express, reason about, and
compute with higher categorical structures that arise in mathematics, software
and physical systems.

<!-- My current research involves the study of programming languages and logics
known as *homotopy type theories*, and how we can use them to express, reason
about, and compute with higher categorical structures that arise in mathematics,
software and physical systems. -->

Previously, I worked in machine learning and natural language processing at the
[Knowledge Discovery][1.3] group at Fraunhofer IAIS, and on [formalization and
proof assistants][1.4] at the Computational Logic group of the University of
Innsbruck. Prior to that I majored in mathematics at the University of Bonn and
the Australian National University.

    <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
    A current major obstruction to the use of standard homotopy type
    theory as a language for ∞-category theory is the longstanding open problem
    of constructing semisimplicial objects in the universe of types. Numerous
    attempts and a number of clever proposals have all eventually run up against
    essentially the same wall: we have not yet found a way of internalizing the
    tower of coherence conditions required for a correct definition of the
    [n]-matching type for arbitrary n.

    Seemingly distinct is the open problem of whether or not the universe type
    of HoTT models HoTT itself, or, phrased alternatively, if one may find a
    suitable notion of "model of type theory" that classes both the syntactic
    model and the so-called "standard model" of the universe as examples.

    In joint work with Nicolai Kraus we suggest the following line of
    investigation: taking HoTT as our ambient metatheory, we consider internal
    models of type theory and construct semisimplicial types (and more general
    Reedy fibrant diagrams) in them. The case when the internal model is
    set-truncated may be viewed as an inversion of the two-level type theoretic
    setting, and already here the construction of diagrams requires somewhat
    more work than in 2LTT. One aim of this program is to later relax the
    truncation levels in order to yield higher internal models of type theory
    with proof-relevant judgmental equality, and to move our constructions into
    these new settings. Along the way, we prove half of a conjectured
    equivalence between the two open problems mentioned previously: HoTT models
    its own metatheory only if semisimplicial types are constructible; and also
    speculate on possible formulations of the coherence problem for
    semisimplicial types. </details>
