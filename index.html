  <h1>Hi, I'm Josh!</h1>

    I'm a new Ph.D. student in the Computational Logic group of the University of Innsbruck.
  </p>
  <p>
    For my day job I work on improving the current state of interactive theorem provers; I'm currently working on building proof automation for Coq and the <code>ssreflect</code> library, and on integrating the logic and libraries of Isabelle and Mizar.
    More generally, I ponder how to make formal proof systems simple and powerful enough to become standard tools for mathematicians and computer scientists alike.
  </p>
  <p>
    I moonlight as a mathematician interested in type theory, mathematical logic, and formalization.
