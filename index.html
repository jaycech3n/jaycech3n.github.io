            <p>
            I'm a Masters student in mathematics at the University of Bonn.
            I work on type theory and formal proof systems on the one hand, and machine learning and natural language processing on the other.

            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Josh!
                I'm a soon-to-be Masters graduate of the <a href="https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/home?set_language=en">University of Bonn</a>, where I study mathematics and computer science.
                My interests center around the broad themes of computation, logic, and human language, and in particular, how to use computers to augment and automate these processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work has involved both the pure and the applied.
                Most recently I have been working on type theory and automated theorem proving, implementing a working version of homotopy type theory inside the interactive proof assistant <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/">Isabelle</a>.
                Homotopy type theory is a recent approach to extending intuitionistic type theory that is able to natively encode important mathematical concepts such as &ldquo;isomorphism-as-equality&rdquo;, and structures such as fundamental groups.
                Its promise lies in its potential to provide an alternative foundation for large portions of mathematics.
                As a result of its constructive nature it is amenable to mechanization, and in principle any mathematics encoded in it could be automatically checked for correctness or even proved.
                I actively develop the <a href="https://github.com/jaycech3n/Isabelle-HoTT">Isabelle/HoTT</a> object logic as a first attempt to bring support for homotopy type theory to the Isabelle prover.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also work in data mining and natural language processing at the <a href="https://www.iais.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems</a>, where I use probabilistic machine learning models to automatically detect topics in tweet corpora and classify tweets accordingly.
                It is well-known that posts on public social media frequently reflect events occurring in the vicinity of the post location, in near real-time.
                By automatically detecting and classifying such posts, we can quickly identify issues which may be of relevance to law enforcement or emergency and rescue services in much less time than would otherwise be needed by more traditional channels of information.
                My work in this area is part of the <a href="https://www.e2mc-project.eu/">E2mC Project</a>, a pilot project that aims to use social media to enhance the European Union's emergency and natural disaster response service.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some other areas in which I am particularly interested are applications of AI to automated fact-checking, as well as the theory of quantum computation.
                Previously, I studied at the Australian National University <a href="https://maths.anu.edu.au/">Mathematical Sciences Institute</a>, writing my Bachelors thesis in category theory and quantum algebra, applied to low-dimensional topological invariants.
