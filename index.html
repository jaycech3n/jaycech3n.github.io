    <h1>Hi, I'm Josh!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a new Ph.D. student in the Computational Logic group of the University of Innsbruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my day job I work on improving the state of interactive theorem provers today; I'm currently working on building proof automation for Coq and the ssreflect library, and on integrating the logic and libraries of Isabelle and Mizar.
      More generally, I ponder how to make formal proof systems simple and powerful enough to become standard tools for mathematicians and computer scientists alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      I moonlight as a mathematician interested in type theory, mathematical logic, and formalization.
